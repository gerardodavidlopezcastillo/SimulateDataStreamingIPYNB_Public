# SimulateDataStreamingIPYNB_Public

Python code is shared that simulates random events in two scenarios: Technology E-commerce and Megastore in their mobile app. This is done to generate large-scale data that can be processed with Data Engineering tools. Subsequently, this large-scale data (events/triggers) will be used in some of my other repositories to process real-time information.
